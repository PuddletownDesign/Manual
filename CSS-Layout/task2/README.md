# Task 2

Match the layout in match in `task2/match-this.png`

## this time i've taken the selectors out.

Elements that are the direct children of section are positioned with `inline-block`. Padding has been added to these elements in percentages as well. 

**hint the percentage of left/right padding + the percentage of width of the children of section need to add up to 100 or less**
