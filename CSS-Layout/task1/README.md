# Task 1

Match the layout in match in `task1/match-this.png`

## WTF is all that shit in the reset.css file??!?!

1. There is the reset. This resets all elements across all browsers to look the same.
2. Then there is a general Typography frame work that I wrote.

** Do not modify the reset.css in making the design, they sit on top and provide a basis for you to work off of. **

You begin writing below these in the css. I've added the selectors I used for you already.
