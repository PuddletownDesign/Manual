# Positioning and layout

## Display

## Position
`position:fixed` the element remains in place on the page, regardless of scrolling and other elements. 

`position: static` elements are static by default in HTML; this can be used to override another property. Static elements will appear within the flow of the page.

`position: relative` Setting the top, right, bottom, and left properties of a relatively-positioned element will cause it to be adjusted away from its normal position. *Other content will not be adjusted to fit into any gap left by the element.*

`position: absolute` The element will be positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor (instead of positioned relative to the viewport, like fixed).
However; if an absolute positioned element has no positioned ancestors, it uses the document body, and moves along with page scrolling.
