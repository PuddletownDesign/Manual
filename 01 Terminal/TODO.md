# Terminal Todo

1. **In Git, Make sure that each commit only contains changes to one directory at a time.** This way it will be easier to review changes for each edit. This is done by only `add`ing one directories files at a time or `stash`ing others before commiting.

2. After you complete each list of these todos, delete the line numbers with the instructions. This way I can pull your changes, run a `diff` and see what your completed tasks were.
