# Terminal Todo

1. **In Git, Make sure that each commit only contains changes to one directory at a time.** This way it will be easier to review changes for each edit. This is done by only `add`ing one directories files at a time or `stash`ing others before commiting.

2. Compare my version of `01 Terminal/README.md` to yours. After pulling my changes, run a `diff` on `01 Terminal/README.md`. You can also check out a headless file to compare the changes directly, in context, not just line by line. Then delete the headless file so you don't commit it.

3. After you complete each list of these todos, delete the line numbers with the instructions. This way I can pull your changes, run a `diff` and see what your completed tasks were.
