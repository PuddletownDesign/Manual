# HTML Structural Elements

## Inline vs Block tags

The easiest way to think of inline vs block is:

* Block tags display as a new line
* Inline tags

Most of the tags from the previous lesson were inline. With the exceptions of the `h1-h6 tags, ul, ol, li, p`.



## List of tags

### Global

* `<html>` - The global tag - decares the document as HTML
* `<head>` - The head of the page. Is not displayed in the browser. Scripts, css and page meta data is usually located here.
* `<body>` - The body of the page that displays in the browser. All of your content will go here

### Structural

* `<nav>` - The main navigation element for the page. Usually the site menu
* `<main>` - The main area of the page. The focal point
* `<article>` - An article
* `<aside>` - A side to an article or main area (a sidebar, extra information relating to the content)
* `<header>` - The header of the page or main/article tags
* `<footer>` - The footer of the page or main/article tags

### Content

* `<figure>` - A group of media contents. Think of a group of images or even just one image
* `<figcaption>` - A caption to the contents of figure. (Must be displayed inside figure)
