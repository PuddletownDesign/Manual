# scrum Planning & Agile Development

Agile is encompassing term for different approaches to working with teams of people.

scrum is a type of agile development. It's one of many patterns for implementing it. It's probably the most popular pattern (framework).

It has a lot of zany terms like sprints, stories and stand ups. These will translate over to other agile/scrum teams that you work with.

Here's a general overview of the scrum approach of agile development.

While you're reading this over, imagine how we will be using it. We are going to

1.  Discuss the over all path (Daily Standup)
2.  Plan and assign small tasks  (sprint planning)
3.  Estimate how long each task will take  (story estimation)
4.  Put it on a chart (aka Storyboard)
5.  Show completed work (Sprint demo)
6.  Figure out the weak points or if things could have gone better (Sprint retrospective)

We will be using trello as a Storyboard. We will use a [plugin for trello to provide us with a burndown chart](https://www.burndownfortrello.com/#). Go ahead and connect that to our trello board.

Al though unorthodox, I will be both product owner/ scrum masta. You will be scrum team.

## Backlog

To make sure you don't get bored, I'm going to begin assigning a number of different tasks to you at once. You will pick them off of the backlog (a common running lists of tasks that need to be done).

## Estimation

You will be in charge of estimating the amount of time that a sprint will take. If it seems complex, if you have other things going on.

You want to learn how to estimate how long any given thing will take to accomplish. We will disuss in the next demo/retrospective and reassign the task.

This whole thing is a continuous exercise in learning how to estimate what you're doing.

### Planning Poker

When you pull items off the backlog you will assign story points to them based on the estimated complexity of the task at hand.

Points will range on a scale of 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 20, 40, 100.

This will help discourage items from sitting in the backlog too long. If you keep neglecting certain items over newer ones, we will be able to identify those as assign them as needed.

Often theres a couple of items on the back log like:

> Fix impossible long running, hair pulling bug that's driven half of the product owners customers away.

We want to avoid that. We will break things up into smaller tasks.
