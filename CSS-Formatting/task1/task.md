# CSS Basic

CSS is the styling language used to apply to HTML. You select HTML elements and apply styles to them.

## Task

I've created the CSS wireframe for you to try to fill in.

You need to figure out values and the tags that you apply them too.

Try to match the screen shot by adding CSS into the style.css file.

## DO NOT CHANGE THE index.html FILE!!

### These are all the CSS styles that I used to generate the example:

* background-color
* padding
* margin
* width
* text-align
* color

## Basic workflow... at least for now ;)

### you'll have to open the page in chrome

1. make change
2. save file
3. tab over to and refresh browser
4. see if changes are correct
5. repeat

I've included the html, body and h1 tags for you for reference. Look them up and figure out where to apply them. Have fun with the `blockquote`.

CSS will take some serious reading, but it's very very very simple once you get the hang of it. I have a lot of opinions on the subject. Lucky for you it's about 400% easier than it was 10 years ago for various reasons.

**Code snippets and shortcuts are 100% required at this point.** You want to be able to toggle through list of values per keybord shortcut. There's a lot here to memorize unfortunately.

## Additional reading

Start reading up on CSS and modify this html and css file and experiment after the task is complete. We'll Cover layouts and more advanced features after a little more HTML and some theory.

I suggest reading through at least the long ass first page here:

# Neat shit to think about

So... you apply CSS to HTML. Markdown turns into HTML. Applying CSS to processed markdown is literally applying CSS to HTML. Markdown = HTML (after it's processed).

Knowing that, a markdown /#/# turns into an h2 means then in css:

```css
h2 {
	color: green;
}
```

## ยก Important !

Even though markdown is so easy, **think in HTML, not markdown**, even when writing markdown. Markdown is a subset that you can turn into HTML. It's only for content areas. HTML itself is more powerful and extensive. In chamber 5 we'll explore more of what HTML can do.
