# Javascript

For most of this part you will be working through the book *You Don't know Javascript*. Read each of the books through beginning to end.

## How to use these books

Use chrome developer tools to load and run each of the examples in this book. Set break points in any code you are not 100% sure how it's executing. Make sure to understand each concept and example.

Make sure to make use of or create snippets for any general code blocks or functions or keywords you come across.

### About ES6 References in the book

For whatever reason the author included several code examples in ES6. This is the next version of javascript that will begin using soon. Examples written in ES6 are to be modified to work with javascript ES5.

Replace the following keywords in examples

	1. 	Replace `const` with `var`
	2.	Replace `let` with `var`

## Basic structures


### Conditionals

#### if / elseif / else

The most commonly used type of conditional statement

#### switch

the less used type. has the advantage of being able to *fall through* conditions.

*Sometimes it looks a little bit more elegant too... IMHO*

#### Ternary

the least used but most compact type of conditional.

### Loops

### for

The most common for scanning over number arrays

### foreach

The most common for scanning over named properties/keys

#### while / do while
