Once all set up, go through and start picking out fonts for each form section. I think you should look up those california signs and try to find close fonts to the headers and body on google fonts. Take liberties and add as many different fonts to the different form blocks. Feel free to use as many fonts as you want (total on the page)/ (no more than 2 per block). *also feel free to add or move around text in the index.html*. Try to create compelling looking type. **Focus on good pairings.**
