# UX (User Experience) / UI (User Interface)

**UX** - User experience. How the user experiences a design.
**UI** - User Interface. How the user interfaces with the design.

In this chapter we will explore more theoretical ideas on how to develop and design objects for the user.

## Required reading

*   *The Design of Everyday Things*
*   *Don't Make Me Think*

## UI Prototyping Tools

There's multiple ways to create a UI prototype

*   Applications such as [sketch](http://www.bohemiancoding.com/sketch/)
*   paper/pencil or white board
*   Photoshop/ AI
*   HTML/ CSS

I personally usually stick with HTML/CSS or paper and pencil. Often times take notes on my laptop and later will go over them with a pencil and paper.

A lot of people and companies are using sketch and other similar UI apps now. It might be good to look into. To me it feels like writing CSS in a GUI and it's kind of uncomfortable.

This is personal preference or sometimes there's requirements that a owner or manager will give you.

Most of the time I wait until after my meeting with a client to begin prototyping. I'll take piles of notes while still trying to listen and be engaging. Sometimes, it will be handy to sketch out an idea or two if you start discussing interface options, though I usually try to steer the conversation away from that and focus on the client and users:

*   Needs
*   Goals
*   Expectations

Once I get home, I'll organize my notes, and begin working out ideas.

Usually with these sorts of designs (page layouts and interactions) there is a best way to do it. Many people have solved similar problems before and there's a lot of reference material. Most of it is very intuitive.

### Example

Imagine a restaurant asked you for a page. The user has a limited sets of predicable needs. Why would someone go to a restaurant website?

1.  To see what's to eat
2.  To see if they're open
3.  To see where they are or how to contact them

Very few people on the other hand give a shit about their:

1.  Instagram feed
2.  Chefs name and bio
3.  Mission statement

Different restaurants are different, but more focus on:

1.  Serving food
2.  at a particular place
3.  at particular times

Maybe they focus on music and drink? Then events and booze should be 1 and 2.

The same is true with just about all designs be it music, perfume, programs, power tools or library cards. The design delivers specific features that the user needs to fulfill their goal.

The goal is to go above and beyond and actually help the user to enjoy using tool. Not just so that it works well, but that it's sexy and feels good.

## KISS

Keep It Simple Stupid. That's it. Look at the needs of the user and the goals and expectations of the owner. You'll be the expert here. You will know much more what the user wants.

### Function over Form

Always. There's never a time to deviate from this. If you don't it's called *polishing a turd*. This is what separates good design from bad and also makes design such an interesting endeavor.

Functioning is objective. It works well or it doesn't.

Form is subjective. It's in the eye of the beholder.

Good design is where art meets a practical function.

A good design is expressive towards the need it seeks to fulfill.

## Iterative Design

A visonary designer can fulfill the above while serving a need that has not been addressed yet.

A great designer can take an existing design and improve on it.

*   Coke/ Pepsi
*   Transformers/Go Bots
*   Hydrox/Oreos

In one of these the sequel was vastly improved. There is great value in finding weak points in existing designs and being able to improve on them.

Nobody wants to be eating hydrox. Yes, Hydrox came first. Yet, a  hydrox was such a compelling design in the first place that someone felt the need to make it better by simply adding a little bit more filling and making it not taste gross. This design became the basis for a mass produced cookie empire that has evolved and dominated for generations. It's iterative improvement.

*Good thing Hydrox didn't have vicious cookie IP lawyers that wore oreo down until they were forced out of business or aquired by hydrox for a fraction of their worth. Actually, I guess [they did](http://empirenews.net/hydrox-to-sue-oreo-over-copyright-infringement-claims-company-copied-their-cookies/) in 2015, over a 103 years after oreo was founded. Hydrox claims it was a big case to build and needed time.*
